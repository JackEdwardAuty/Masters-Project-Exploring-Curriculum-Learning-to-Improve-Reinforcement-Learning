\chapter*{Summary}
The widely adopted approach to human education is organised in a hierarchical fashion, such that ‘easier’ content - generally content considered to be logically prerequisite to later content - is taught initially, prior to more ‘difficult’ content. Within this system, over the course of a students’ education within a field they are gradually exposed to its more complex content, allowing them to apply previously learned concepts as required to build a more thorough and complete understanding of that field. This approach to learning is often formalised under the broader concept known as a ‘Curriculum’, and we will be adapting and applying this ‘Curriculum Learning’ approach for use within the Reinforcement Learning paradigm. Specifically, we will be exploring its use within a modified version of an OpenAI environment utilising the MuJoCo physics engine \cite{multi-agent-tool}. We found that through the application of curriculum learning techniques, the speed to convergence, and performance of the agent improved massively over traditional reinforcement learning approaches.

%Our exploration will involve the comparison of the agent's performance against a traditional reinforcement learning approach, along with between curriculum learning approaches that employ varying progression functions - that is ways of determining when the agent should progress to the next task \cite{misc01}.%
